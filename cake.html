      <pre>Cake is a flour confection made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, and is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread,
         but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, 
         and which share features with desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies</pre>
